    "# Outbound Auth\n",
    "\n",
    "Outbound Auth allows agents and the AgentCore Gateway to securely access AWS resources and third-party services on behalf of users who have been authenticated and authorized during Inbound Auth. To integrate authorization with an AWS resource or third-party service, it's necessary to configure both Inbound Auth and Outbound Auth.\n",
    "\n",
    "With just-enough access and secure permission delegation supported by AgentCore Identity, agents can seamlessly and securely access AWS resources and third-party tools such as GitHub, Google, Salesforce, and Slack. Agents can perform actions on these services either on behalf of users or independently, provided there is pre-authorized user consent. Additionally, you can reduce consent fatigue using a secure token vault and create streamlined AI agent experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outbound Authentication Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you register your client application with third-party providers and then create an Outbound Auth. You specify how you want to validate access to the AWS resource or third-party service or AgentCore Gateway targets. You can use OAuth 2LO/3LO or API keys. With OAuth, you can select from providers that AgentCore Identity provides. In which case you enter the configuration details for the providers from AgentCore Identity. Alternatively, you can supply details for a custom provider. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a user wants access to an AWS resource or third-party service or AgentCore Gateway target, the Outbound Auth confirms that the access tokens provided by Incoming Auth are valid and if so, allows access to the resource.\n",

    "## Resource credential providers\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a component that agent code uses to retrieve credentials of downstream resource servers (e.g., Google, GitHub) to access them, e.g., fetch emails from Gmail, add a meeting to Google Calendar.  It removes the heavy-lifting of agent developers implementing 2LO and 3LO OAuth2 orchestration flows across end-users, agent code, and external authorization servers. AgentCore provides both a custom OAuth2 credential provider and a list of built-in providers such Google, GitHub, Slack, Salesforce with authorization server endpoint and provider-specific parameters pre-filled.\n",

    "Bedrock AgentCore Identity provides OAuth2 and API Key Credential Providers for agent developers to authenticate with external resources that support OAuth2 or API key.

Please refer to the documentation for the other credential providers.\n",
