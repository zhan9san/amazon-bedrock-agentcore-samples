# SRE Agent - Multi-Agent Site Reliability Engineering Assistant

## Overview

The SRE Agent is a multi-agent system for Site Reliability Engineers that helps investigate infrastructure issues. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and powered by Amazon Nova and Anthropic Claude models (Claude can be accessed through Amazon Bedrock or directly through Anthropic), this system uses specialized AI agents that collaborate to investigate issues, analyze logs, monitor performance metrics, and execute operational procedures. The AgentCore Gateway provides access to data sources and systems available as MCP tools. This example also demonstrates how to deploy the agent using the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime for production environments.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples
cd amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples/02-use-cases/SRE-agent

# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the SRE Agent and dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example sre_agent/.env
# Edit sre_agent/.env and add your Anthropic API key:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# Openapi Templates get replaced with your backend domain and saved as .yaml
BACKEND_DOMAIN=api.mycompany.com ./backend/openapi_specs/generate_specs.sh

# Get your EC2 instance private IP for server binding
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
  -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600" -s)

> **Local Setup Complete**: Your SRE Agent is now running locally on your EC2 instance and is exercising the AgentCore Gateway and Memory services. If you want to deploy this agent on AgentCore Runtime so you can integrate it into your applications (like a chatbot, Slack bot, etc.), follow the instructions in the [Development to Production Deployment Flow](#development-to-production-deployment-flow) section below.

## Execution instructions

### Memory-Enhanced Personalized Investigations

The SRE Agent includes a sophisticated memory system that personalizes investigations based on user preferences. The system comes preconfigured with two user personas in [`scripts/user_config.yaml`](scripts/user_config.yaml):

- **Alice**: Technical detailed investigations with comprehensive analysis and team alerts
- **Carol**: Executive-focused investigations with business impact analysis and strategic alerts

When running investigations with different user IDs, the agent produces similar technical findings but presents them according to each user's preferences:

```bash
# Alice's detailed technical investigation
USER_ID=Alice sre-agent --prompt "API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour" --provider bedrock

# Carol's executive-focused investigation  
USER_ID=Carol sre-agent --prompt "API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour" --provider bedrock
```

Both commands will identify identical technical issues but present them differently:
- **Alice** receives detailed technical analysis with step-by-step troubleshooting and team notifications
- **Carol** receives executive summaries focused on business impact with rapid escalation timelines

For a detailed comparison showing how the memory system personalizes identical incidents, see: [**Memory System Report Comparison**](docs/examples/Memory_System_Analysis_User_Personalization_20250802_162648.md)

### Single Query Mode
```bash
# Investigate specific pod issues
sre-agent --prompt "Why are the payment-service pods crash looping?"

# Analyze performance degradation
sre-agent --prompt "Investigate high latency in the API gateway over the last hour"

# Search for error patterns
sre-agent --prompt "Find all database connection errors in the last 24 hours"
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
# Start interactive conversation
sre-agent --interactive

# Available commands in interactive mode:
# /help     - Show available commands
# /agents   - List available specialist agents
# /history  - Show conversation history
# /save     - Save the current conversation
# /clear    - Clear conversation history
# /exit     - Exit the interactive session
```

#### Advanced Options
```bash
# Use Amazon Bedrock
sre-agent --provider bedrock --query "Check cluster health"

# Save investigation reports to custom directory
sre-agent --output-dir ./investigations --query "Analyze memory usage trends"

# Use Amazon Bedrock with specific profile
AWS_PROFILE=production sre-agent --provider bedrock --interactive
```

## Development to Production Deployment Flow

The SRE Agent follows a structured deployment process from local development to production on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. For detailed instructions, see the **[Deployment Guide](docs/deployment-guide.md)**.

Key Points:
• Core agent code (sre_agent/) remains unchanged
• Deployment/ folder contains all deployment-specific utilities
• Same agent works locally and in production via environment config
• AgentCore Gateway provides MCP tools access at all stages
```

## Deploying Your Agent on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime

For production deployments, you can deploy the SRE Agent directly to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. This provides a scalable, managed environment for running your agent with enterprise-grade security and monitoring.

The AgentCore Runtime deployment supports:
- **Container-based deployment** with automatic scaling
- **Multiple LLM providers** (Amazon Bedrock or Anthropic Claude)
- **Debug mode** for troubleshooting and development
- **Environment-based configuration** for different deployment stages
- **Secure credential management** through AWS IAM and environment variables

For complete step-by-step instructions including local testing, container building, and production deployment, see the **[Deployment Guide](docs/deployment-guide.md)**.

## Maintenance and Operations

### Restarting Backend Servers and Refreshing Access Token

To maintain connectivity with the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway, you need to periodically restart backend servers and refresh the access token. Run the gateway configuration script:

```bash
# Important: Run this from within the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # If not already activated
./scripts/configure_gateway.sh
```

**What this script does:**
- **Stops running backend servers** to ensure clean restart
- **Generates a new access token** for AgentCore Gateway authentication
- **Gets the EC2 instance private IP** for proper SSL binding
- **Starts backend servers** with SSL certificates (HTTPS) or HTTP fallback
- **Updates gateway URI** in the agent configuration from `gateway/.gateway_uri`
- **Updates access token** in the `.env` file for agent authentication

**Important:** You must run this script **every 24 hours** because the access token expires after 24 hours. If you don't refresh the token:
- The SRE agent will lose connection to the AgentCore gateway
- No MCP tools will be available (Kubernetes, logs, metrics, runbooks APIs)
- Investigations will fail as agents cannot access backend services

For more details, see the [configure_gateway.sh](scripts/configure_gateway.sh) script.

### Troubleshooting Gateway Connection Issues

If you encounter "gateway connection failed" or "MCP tools unavailable" errors:
1. Check if the access token has expired (24-hour limit)
2. Run `./scripts/configure_gateway.sh` to refresh authentication (from within the virtual environment)
3. Verify backend servers are running with `ps aux | grep python`
4. Check SSL certificate validity if using HTTPS

## Clean up instructions

### Complete AWS Resource Cleanup

For complete cleanup of all AWS resources (Gateway, Runtime, and local files):

```bash
# Complete cleanup - deletes AWS resources and local files
./scripts/cleanup.sh

# Or with custom names
./scripts/cleanup.sh --gateway-name my-gateway --runtime-name my-runtime

# Force cleanup without confirmation prompts
./scripts/cleanup.sh --force
```

This script will:
- Stop backend servers
- Delete the AgentCore Gateway and all its targets
- Delete memory resources
- Delete the AgentCore Runtime
- Remove generated files (gateway URIs, tokens, agent ARNs, memory IDs)

### Manual Local Cleanup Only

If you only want to clean up local files without touching AWS resources:

```bash
# Stop all demo servers
cd backend
./scripts/stop_demo_backend.sh
cd ..

# Clean up generated files only
rm -rf gateway/.gateway_uri gateway/.access_token
rm -rf deployment/.agent_arn .memory_id

# Note: .env, .venv, and reports/ are preserved for development continuity
```

## Disclaimer
The examples provided in this repository are for experimental and educational purposes only. They demonstrate concepts and techniques but are not intended for direct use in production environments. Make sure to have Amazon Bedrock Guardrails in place to protect against [prompt injection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-injection.html).

**Important Note**: The data in [`backend/data`](backend/data) is synthetically generated, and the backend directory contains stub servers that showcase how a real SRE agent backend could work. In a production environment, these implementations would need to be replaced with real implementations that connect to actual systems, use vector databases, and integrate with other data sources.
